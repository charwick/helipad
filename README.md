# Helipad

Helipad is an agent-based modeling framework for Python with powerful visualization capabilities and a shallow learning curve. Documentation and API reference can be found at [helipad.dev](https://helipad.dev).

## Features

* ‚öìÔ∏è A simple [hook-based API](https://helipad.dev/glossary/hooks/) makes it easy to build a model without worrying about the features you don‚Äôt need
* üìà Interactive and live-updating visualizations, including time series, bar charts, networks, spatial, and an API for writing custom visualizations
* üëãüèª Flexible parameter API allows parameter values to be set programmatically, adjusted manually from the control panel while the model is running, or shocked stochastically
* ü™ê Cross-platform and multimodal. Models can be written and run with a Tkinter GUI, in Jupyter notebooks, or without a GUI at all
* ü§πüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Agents can barter, buy and sell with money, reproduce both haploid and polyploid, and more
* üï∫üèª A variety of model types: sequential or random-activation models, matching models, multi-level models, network models, spatial models, and more

## How to Use

You can install Helipad using either Pip or Conda, depending on your preferred package manager.

	pip install helipad
 
	conda install -c charwick helipad

Once installed, getting started with a model is very simple. 

	from helipad import *
	heli = Helipad()
	
	#Use the heli object to set up here
	
	heli.launchCpanel()

The included [bootstrap model](https://github.com/charwick/helipad/blob/master/sample-models/bootstrap.py) contains a more detailed template, and the [sample models](https://github.com/charwick/helipad/tree/master/sample-models) exemplify various use cases. The documentation also includes a complete [hook and function reference](https://helipad.dev/functions/).

## Requirements

Helipad requires Python 3.7 or higher. The following libraries are also required:

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for visualization
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data collection
* [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/) for network analysis and spatial visualization
* _Optional:_ [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [Ipywidgets](https://pypi.org/project/ipywidgets/), and [ipympl](https://github.com/matplotlib/ipympl) to run Helipad in Jupyter notebooks
